# Desktop and Chrome Extension release packaging

## Windows desktop

Use Node.js 24 LTS or newer on Windows:

```powershell
cd frontend/desktop
npm ci
npm run typecheck
$env:VITE_API_BASE_URL="https://api.prewise.site"
npm run release:windows
```

The command builds two x64 artifacts in `frontend/desktop/release/`:

- `Prewise-Armor-<version>-Setup-x64.exe` — interactive NSIS installer.
- `Prewise-Armor-<version>-Portable-x64.exe` — portable application.

The release scripts fail closed unless `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is an HTTPS,
non-local production endpoint without embedded credentials. Development builds
may continue to use the localhost default. A plain production Vite build uses
`https://api.prewise.site` as a safe fallback and validates the generated
bundle so a packaged application cannot silently retain the localhost URL.

`electron-builder` reads its signing identity from the standard `CSC_LINK` and
`CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` environment variables. CI leaves these unset for pull
requests and unsigned internal builds. A public release must provide the
certificate through protected CI secrets and verify the resulting
Authenticode signature before publication.

## Chrome Extension

From the repository root:

```powershell
python scripts/package_extension.py --check
python scripts/package_extension.py
```

The packager validates Manifest V3 references, JavaScript syntax, locale
resources, external scripts, inline event handlers, and the reviewed
permission allowlist. It then creates a reproducible ZIP whose manifest is at
the archive root. Development-only files and icon-generation scripts are not
included.

The extension does not request `scripting`. Its broad HTTPS host access remains
necessary because protection automatically evaluates visited tab URLs and
supports a user-configured HTTPS Gateway. Gmail content access is separately
limited to `https://mail.google.com/*`. Replacing automatic protection with an
on-click-only workflow would allow migration to optional host permissions.

## Checksums

Collect publishable artifacts in one directory and run:

```powershell
node scripts/hash_artifacts.mjs artifacts
```

Publish the generated `SHA256SUMS.txt` beside the artifacts. Release jobs must
also retain the immutable source commit and the exact package lock used to
produce them.
